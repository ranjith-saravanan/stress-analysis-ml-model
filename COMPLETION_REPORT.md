## 📊 RESULTS SUMMARY

### Most Important Findings

1. **Screen Time is the Critical Factor** 🚨
   - 74% correlation with stress (strongest predictor)
   - More important than social media abstinence duration
   - Recommendation: Focus on reducing screen time

2. **Two Distinct User Phenotypes** 👥
   - High-stress cluster: 6.85 hrs screen time, poor sleep
   - Well-balanced cluster: 4.29 hrs screen time, good sleep
   - Personalized interventions needed

3. **Sleep Quality Matters** 😴
   - -59% correlation with stress
   - +68% correlation with happiness
   - Strong protective factor

4. **Social Media Abstinence Has Minimal Direct Effect** 📱
   - Only -0.8% correlation with stress
   - Only +6.4% correlation with happiness
   - Effect mediated by other factors

### Model Performance
- **Simple Regression**: R² < 0.01 (days alone not predictive)
- **Multiple Regression**: R² = 0.55 (multiple factors explain 55%)
- **Random Forest**: ~50% prediction accuracy (good for social science)

## 💼 INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### When Discussing This Project:

**1. Problem Statement**
"I analyzed how social media abstinence affects mental health using a dataset of 500 users. The goal was to identify key factors influencing stress and happiness."

**2. Methodology**
"I implemented a 7-phase analysis pipeline: data preprocessing, EDA, correlation analysis, regression modeling, user clustering, advanced ML with Random Forest, and results synthesis."

**3. Key Finding #1**
"Surprisingly, I found that daily screen time was far more important than abstinence duration—74% correlation with stress versus only -0.8% for abstinence days."

**4. Key Finding #2**
"Using K-Means clustering, I identified two distinct user phenotypes: high-stress users with poor sleep and excessive screen time, and well-balanced users with moderate habits."

**5. Technical Highlights**
"I used multiple algorithms: Linear and Multiple Regression for statistical analysis, Random Forest for prediction achieving 48-50% accuracy, and K-Means and DBSCAN for user segmentation. I also applied PCA for visualization."

**6. Business Impact**
"The findings suggest mental health interventions should focus on reducing overall screen time and improving sleep quality, rather than promoting complete social media abstinence."

**7. Challenges Overcome**
"The main challenge was that simple abstinence had minimal correlation. I addressed this by implementing multiple regression to control for confounding variables, revealing the true multi-factor nature of mental health."
