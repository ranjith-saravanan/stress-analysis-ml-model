## 🔬 Key Findings

### 1. Correlation Analysis
- **Days without social media vs Stress**: r = -0.0080 (weak negative correlation)
- **Days without social media vs Happiness**: r = 0.0635 (weak positive correlation)
- **Screen time vs Stress**: r = 0.7399 (strong positive correlation) ⚠️
- **Screen time vs Happiness**: r = -0.7052 (strong negative correlation)
- **Sleep Quality vs Stress**: r = -0.5849 (moderate negative correlation)
- **Sleep Quality vs Happiness**: r = 0.6788 (moderate positive correlation)

### 2. Regression Analysis Performance

#### Simple Linear Regression
- **Stress Model**: R² = 0.0001 (Days Without Social Media alone has minimal predictive power)
- **Happiness Model**: R² = 0.0040

#### Multiple Regression (with control variables)
- **Stress Model**: R² = 0.5522 (55.2% variance explained)
- **Happiness Model**: R² = 0.5494 (54.9% variance explained)

#### Random Forest (Advanced ML)
- **Stress Prediction**: R² = 0.4812, MAE = 0.90 points
- **Happiness Prediction**: R² = 0.4936, MAE = 0.89 points

### 3. User Segmentation

#### K-Means Clustering (Optimal K=2)
**Cluster 0 (High Stress, Lower Happiness) - 242 users**
- Average Daily Screen Time: 6.85 hrs
- Average Stress Level: 7.74
- Average Happiness: 7.19
- Average Sleep Quality: 5.22

**Cluster 1 (Low Stress, Higher Happiness) - 258 users**
- Average Daily Screen Time: 4.29 hrs
- Average Stress Level: 5.57
- Average Happiness: 9.48
- Average Sleep Quality: 7.32

#### DBSCAN Clustering
- Identified 1 cluster with 500 noise points
- Suggests relatively uniform distribution without clear density-based clusters

### 4. Feature Importance
**Most Important Predictors:**
1. **Daily Screen Time** - Most influential for both stress and happiness
2. Sleep Quality
3. Age
4. Exercise Frequency
5. Days Without Social Media

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

### Major Discoveries

1. **Screen Time is the Critical Factor**
   - 74% correlation with stress (strongest predictor)
   - More important than social media abstinence duration
   - Recommendation: Focus on reducing screen time rather than complete abstinence

2. **Sleep Quality Matters Significantly**
   - Strong protective factor for mental health
   - Better sleep = lower stress, higher happiness
   - Recommendation: Prioritize sleep hygiene interventions

3. **Two Distinct User Phenotypes**
   - **Cluster 0**: High-stress users with poor sleep and excessive screen time
   - **Cluster 1**: Well-balanced users with moderate screen time and good sleep
   - Recommendation: Personalized interventions based on cluster membership

4. **Social Media Abstinence Has Minimal Direct Effect**
   - Very weak correlation with outcomes when analyzed alone
   - Effect is mediated by other factors (screen time, sleep, exercise)
   - Recommendation: Holistic approach rather than simple abstinence

### Practical Applications

1. **Mental Health Interventions**
   - Screen time reduction programs
   - Sleep quality improvement initiatives
   - Exercise encouragement
   - Personalized plans based on user cluster

2. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Random Forest models can predict stress/happiness with ~50% accuracy
   - Can be used for early warning systems
   - Identify at-risk individuals (Cluster 0)

3. **Individual Assessment**
   - Users can determine their cluster membership
   - Receive personalized recommendations
   - Track progress over time
