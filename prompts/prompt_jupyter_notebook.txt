# Jupyter Notebook Prompt

Create a Jupyter notebook structured into the following sections with markdown and code cells:
1. Setup & Data Loading
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Regression Analysis
4. Clustering
5. Time Series (Prophet & LSTM)
6. Feature Importance (RandomForest/XGBoost + SHAP)
7. NLP Sentiment Analysis
8. Dashboard Prototype (Streamlit)

Instructions:
- Keep each section modular so users can run cells independently.
- Provide small runnable examples and helper functions.
- Include a final 'How to run' cell with environment setup and commands.
