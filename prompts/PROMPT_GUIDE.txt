# Master Prompt Guide

Which prompt to use:
- Full project: ai_assistant_prompt.txt
- Quick code: prompt_python_implementation.txt
- Notebook-ready: prompt_jupyter_notebook.txt
- Focused analysis: prompt_specific_analysis.txt
- Research writing: prompt_research_paper_format.txt
- Dashboard: prompt_dashboard_app.txt
- Beginner tutorial: prompt_step_by_step_beginner.txt

How to use:
1. Open a prompt file and copy its contents into your AI assistant.
2. Optionally, prepend a short context about your dataset (columns, sample size, target variable).
3. Ask for iterative improvements: "Refine model performance", "Add tests", "Make dashboard responsive".

Tips:
- Provide a small sample of your real dataset to get the most accurate code.
- Ask for exact package versions if you need reproducibility.
- Use the beginner prompt if you want explanations alongside code.

Troubleshooting:
- If the AI produces errors, paste the stack trace and ask for fixes.
- If results look unrealistic, request a data validation step and sanity checks.
