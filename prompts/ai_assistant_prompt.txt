# AI Assistant Prompt â€” Comprehensive Full Project Prompt

Goal: Implement the Social Media Detox Effect Analyzer end-to-end. Follow 6 phases and produce runnable code, tests, and a Streamlit dashboard.

Phases:
1. Data Generation & Preprocessing
   - Generate synthetic longitudinal user-level and session-level data with realistic correlations.
   - Validate data types and produce CSV/Parquet.
   - Create preprocessing pipeline: imputers, scalers, feature engineering (rolling windows, deltas, buckets).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Produce descriptive stats, histograms and boxplots, correlation heatmap, and per-user time series.
   - Produce a formal EDA report (markdown + figures) suitable for publication.

3. Correlation & Regression Analysis
   - Compute Pearson and Spearman coefficients between Days_Without_Social_Media and Happiness/Stress.
   - Fit linear and polynomial regressions with cross-validation; report coefficients, RMSE, R^2.

4. Clustering Analysis (K-Means & DBSCAN)
   - Aggregate per-user features and run K-Means with silhouette analysis and elbow method.
   - Run DBSCAN to find density-based groups. Label clusters with human-friendly profiles.

5. Time Series Prediction (LSTM & ARIMA/Prophet)
   - Build per-user time-series forecasting for Happiness and Stress.
   - Implement Prophet for explainable trends and LSTM for learned patterns. Use sliding-window validation.

6. Advanced Features & Dashboard
   - Build a Streamlit dashboard with interactive controls, upload CSV, per-user view, and simulation controls.
   - Add a recommendation engine: hybrid rules + uplift model to estimate Happiness gain from an intervention.

Deliverables:
- Jupyter notebook(s) with each phase.
- Scripted pipeline modules (data/, models/, dashboards/).
- requirements.txt and README.md with run instructions.
- Unit tests (pytest) for core functions and model wrappers.

Constraints & Notes:
- Prioritize privacy: do not send personal data to external APIs. Use on-device inference for PII-sensitive tasks.
- Use seed for reproducibility. Log random seeds and versions.
- Provide clear comments and docstrings.

Ask follow-ups if data format or target variables differ from the sample.
