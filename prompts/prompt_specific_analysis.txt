# Specific Analysis Focus Prompt

Use this prompt to request a focused analysis of one component. Options:
- "Correlation analysis only": return code to compute and visualize Pearson/Spearman coefficients.
- "Regression with feature importance": provide regression pipeline and feature importance via SHAP.
- "Clustering analysis": produce K-Means with cluster characterization and DBSCAN alternative.
- "LSTM time series": implement LSTM sequence model with evaluation and sample results.

Output:
- Minimal runnable code for the requested component.
- One example dataset generation if user hasn't provided data.
- Clear inputs/outputs contract for the function(s) provided.
