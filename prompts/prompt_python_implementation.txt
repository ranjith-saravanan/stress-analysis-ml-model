# Quick Python Implementation Prompt

Produce ready-to-run Python code for:
- Synthetic dataset generation with realistic correlations.
- Data saving/loading (CSV/Parquet) and basic validation.
- Correlation analysis (Pearson & Spearman) with plots.
- Linear and multiple regression including polynomial features; show RMSE and R^2.
- K-Means clustering (with elbow & silhouette) and DBSCAN example.
- LSTM time series model with 7-day lookback and training loop.
- Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn (and optional Plotly for interactivity).

Output requirements:
- Provide code blocks runnable in a Jupyter notebook.
- Include brief comments explaining key steps.
- Keep dependencies minimal and list them at top.
- Use sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and tensorflow (or pytorch) for LSTM.
